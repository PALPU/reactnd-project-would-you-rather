# Would You Rather 
"Would You Rather?" is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they havn't answered, see how other poeple have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
